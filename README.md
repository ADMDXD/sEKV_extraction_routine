# sEKV_extraction_routine

On this repository I made available part of my PhD work <3.
You can find two folders:
  - **Extractor codes:** where you can find:
      - **EKV_extractor.py:** which is the python code (V3) that contains the function *EKV_extractor*
      - **EKV_extractor_POC.py:** where POC stands for Proof of Concept. Therefore, is a code, which makes use of the previous function and the transistor data available at the folder *Data*, and you can use it to see what the extractor is doing.
  - **Data:** is data belonging to the irradiation tests presented on my thesis. From this file, the code will extract IDVG characteristics of an nMOS transistor (wide and short)

If you manage to install the function and run the POC file you will get some beautiful plots like these ones:
